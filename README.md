# TheTrickster
The Trickster is a project that uses adversarial attacks to manipulate large language models (LLMs). Adversarial attacks are a type of attack that uses carefully crafted input to cause an LLM to generate unintended or malicious output.

This project is still under development, but it has already been used to successfully attack a number of different LLMs. The project is open source, and the code is available on GitHub.
