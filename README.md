# The Trickster 

This is a project to create a text-based attack on an LLM.

## Project Description 
The project uses adversarial attacks to manipulate large language models (LLMs). Adversarial attacks are a type of attack that uses carefully crafted input to cause an LLM to generate unintended or malicious output. In the case of this project, the goal is to use adversarial attacks to cause an LLM to generate text that is harmful or offensive.

## Project Goals 

The goals of the project are to:
* Develop a new method for attacking LLMs.
* Test the new method on a variety of LLMs. 
* Analyze the results of the attacks. 

## Project Status 

The project is still under development. The new method has been developed, and it has been tested on a few different LLMs. The results of the attacks are still being analyzed.

## Project Requirements 
The project requires Python 3.8 or higher.

## Project Installation Instructions 

To install the project, clone the repository from GitHub.

This is just a basic example, and you may need to add more information depending on the specific project. For example, you may need to include more details about the adversarial attacks that are used, or you may need to provide more instructions on how to use the project.

I hope this helps!
